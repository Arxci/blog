## Introduction

In the fast-paced world of web development, ensuring a delightful user
experience is a top priority. With NextJS 13, the journey to creating smooth
loading states has never been easier. In this post, we'll delve into the art of
implementing loading states in your Next.js applications, taking them from good
to exceptional. Say goodbye to those frustrating, abrupt page transitions, and
welcome your users with a loading experience that leaves a lasting impression.
Let's explore how you can achieve loading state perfection in your Next.js 13
projects and keep your users hooked from the first click.

## Instant Loading State

An instant loading state is fallback UI that is shown immediately upon
navigation. You can pre-render loading indicators such as skeletons and
spinners, or a small but meaningful part of future screens such as a cover
photo, title, etc. This helps users understand the app is responding and
provides a better user experience.

The NextJS app directory has introduced a new file convention; you can now add
all the files and components related to the route in a single directory. In the
route directory, you can include the loading.tsx file to add your loading UI.

```tsx
export default function Loading() {
	// Return your loading UI
	return <Skeleton />
}
```

In the same folder, loading.js will be nested inside layout.js. It will
automatically wrap the page.js file and any children below in a Suspense
boundary.

**It is recommended** to use the loading.tsx convention for route segments
(layouts and pages) as Next.js optimizes this functionality.

## Streaming with Suspense

To learn how Streaming works in React and Next.js, it's helpful to understand
Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and its limitations.

With SSR, there's a series of steps that need to be completed before a user can
see and interact with a page:

1. First, all data for a given page is fetched on the server.
2. The server then renders the HTML for the page.
3. The HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the page are sent to the client.
4. A non-interactive user interface is shown using the generated HTML, and CSS.
5. Finally, React hydrates the user interface to make it interactive.

These steps are sequential and blocking, meaning the server can only render the
HTML for a page once all the data has been fetched. And, on the client, React
can only hydrate the UI once the code for all components in the page has been
downloaded.

SSR with React and NextJS helps improve the perceived loading performance by
showing a non-interactive page to the user as soon as possible.

However, it can still be slow as all data fetching on server needs to be
completed before the page can be shown to the user.

Streaming allows you to break down the page's HTML into smaller chunks and
progressively send those chunks from the server to the client.

### Example

Suspense works by wrapping a component that performs an asynchronous action
(e.g. fetch data), showing fallback UI (e.g. skeleton, spinner) while it's
happening, and then swapping in your component once the action completes.

```tsx
import { Suspense } from 'react'
import { PostFeed, Weather } from './Components'

export default function Posts() {
	return (
		<section>
			<Suspense fallback={<p>Loading feed...</p>}>
				<PostFeed />
			</Suspense>
			<Suspense fallback={<p>Loading weather...</p>}>
				<Weather />
			</Suspense>
		</section>
	)
}
```

## Conclusion

In the realm of web development, the user experience is the crown jewel of any
application. With NextJS 13, crafting a flawless loading state has become not
just achievable but also enjoyable.

Remember, the loading state isn't just about showcasing your technical prowess;
it's about making a promise to your users. It's a commitment that their time and
attention matter. By implementing a well-crafted loading state, you're not only
keeping your users engaged but also building trust and loyalty.
