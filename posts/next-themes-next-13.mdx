## NextThemes Installation

[Next Themes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-themes?activeTab=readme 'title'),
is an abstraction for themes in your NextJS app. Next Themes allows for simple
theme switching with support for system setting with prefers-color-scheme,
synced theme across tabs and windows, dark mode in just two lines of code, and
much more!

To get started install the below package into your NextJS 13 application

```tsx
$ npm install next-themes
```

## NextThemesProvider

Adding dark mode takes two lines of code.

First, create a providers folder in the root of your application. Then, create a
file called NextThemesProvider.tsx

```tsx
'use client'

import { ThemeProvider as Provider } from 'next-themes'
import { ThemeProviderProps } from 'next-themes/dist/types'

export interface NextThemesProviderProps {
	children: React.ReactNode
	themeProps?: ThemeProviderProps
}

const NextThemesProvider: React.FC<NextThemesProviderProps> = ({
	children,
	themeProps,
}) => {
	return <Provider {...themeProps}>{children}</Provider>
}

export default NextThemesProvider
```

Once thats created. Simply head over to the root of your app folder and wrap the
children with the theme provider

```tsx
export default function RootLayout({
	children,
}: {
	children: React.ReactNode
}) {
	return (
		<html
			lang="en"
			suppressHydrationWarning
		>
			<body className={font.className}>
				<NextThemesProvider
					themeProps={{ attribute: 'class', defaultTheme: 'dark' }}
				>
					{children}
				</NextThemesProvider>
			</body>
		</html>
	)
}
```

Once that has been set up, you can start using dark mode! You will need to set
up your styles in your css file.

```tsx
:root {
  /* Your default theme */
  --background: white;
  --foreground: black;
}

[data-theme='dark'] {
  --background: black;
  --foreground: white;
}
```

## UseTheme Hook

That wasn't quite hard. But how can we change the theme at runtime? Well that's
also quite simple with use of the UseTheme() hook provided by NextThemes.

We can create a simple button that will allow us to toggle between light and
dark mode.

Due to NextJS 13 hydration errors we need an initial isMounted check before we
can utilize the theme switcher.

```tsx
'use client'

import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react'

import { useTheme } from 'next-themes'

const DarkModeButton = () => {
	const [mounted, setMounted] = useState(false)
	const { theme, setTheme } = useTheme()
	const isDarkMode = theme === 'dark'

	useEffect(() => {
		setMounted(true)
	}, [])

	if (!mounted) {
		return null
	}

	const themeChangeHandle = () => {
		if (isDarkMode) {
			setTheme('light')
		} else {
			setTheme('dark')
		}
	}

	return (
		<button
			onClick={themeChangeHandle}
		>
			{isDarkMode ? 'Dark Mode' : 'Light Mode}
		</button>
	)
}

export default DarkModeButton
```

And there you go! Thats all you need to get start using NextThemes!
