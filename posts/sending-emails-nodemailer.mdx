In the world of modern web development, creating a full-stack application with
Next.js is a popular choice. However, one essential feature often overlooked is
email communication. Whether you want to send confirmation emails, password
reset links, or notifications, Nodemailer can be your trusted companion. In this
blog post, we will guide you through the process of setting up Nodemailer in
Next.js 13, making email integration a breeze for your application. We will be
using gmail for the service provider.

Gmail either works well, or it does not work at all. It is probably easier to
switch to an alternative service instead of fixing issues with Gmail. If Gmail
does not work for you, then don't use it. Read more about it
[here](https://nodemailer.com/usage/using-gmail/).

## Why Use Nodemailer?

The Nodemailer module makes it easy to send emails from your computer. In this
example we will be creating a simple contact form, that will allow the user to
enter their information and send you an email.

By the end of this comprehensive guide, you'll be well-equipped to set up
Nodemailer in your Next.js 13 application, enabling you to enhance user
engagement and streamline communication. Get ready to unlock the power of email
in your Next.js projects with ease.

## Installing Nodemailer in Next.js 13

All you have to do is run the below command. We will also be using axios to make
api calls to our custom contact route much easier and zod with react hook form
to manage our form

```tsx
$ npm install nodemailer axios react-hook-form @hookform/resolvers/zod zod
```

## Creating the contact form

Let's start by creating our formSchema

```tsx
const formSchema = z.object({
	email: z
		.string()
		.min(1, { message: 'This field has to be filled.' })
		.email('This is not a valid email.'),
	name: z.string().min(1, { message: 'Please enter at least 1 character.' }),
	subject: z.string().min(1, { message: 'Please enter at least 1 character.' }),
	message: z
		.string()
		.min(10, { message: 'Please enter at least 10 characters.' }),
})

//typing for TypeScript
type ProductFormValues = z.infer<typeof formSchema>
```

Next lets initialize our Component

```tsx
const defaultValues = {
	email: '',
	name: '',
	subject: '',
	message: '',
}

const form = useForm<ProductFormValues>({
	resolver: zodResolver(formSchema),
	defaultValues,
})

const submitFormHandle = async (data: ProductFormValues) => {
	try {
		await axios.post('/api/contact', data)

		form.reset()
		console.log('Email Received!')
	} catch (error) {
		console.log('Failed to send email.')
	}
}
```

Now lets add in our JSX

```tsx
return (
	<form onSubmit={form.handleSubmit((data) => submitFormHandle(data))}>
		<div>
			<label htmlFor="email">Email</label>
			<input
				{...form}
				id="email"
				type="email"
				placeholder="Enter your email..."
			/>
			{form.formState.errors.email && (
				<p>form.formState.errors.email.message</p>
			)}
		</div>
		<div>
			<label htmlFor="name">Name</label>
			<input
				{...form}
				id="name"
				type="text"
				placeholder="Enter your name..."
			/>
			{form.formState.errors.name && <p>form.formState.errors.name.message</p>}
		</div>
		<div>
			<label htmlFor="subject">Subject</label>
			<input
				{...form}
				id="subject"
				type="text"
				placeholder="Enter your subject..."
			/>
			{form.formState.errors.subject && (
				<p>form.formState.errors.subject.message</p>
			)}
		</div>
		<div>
			<label htmlFor="message">Subject</label>
			<textarea
				{...form}
				id="message"
				name="message"
				placeholder="Enter your message..."
			/>
			{form.formState.errors.message && (
				<p>form.formState.errors.message.message</p>
			)}
		</div>
		<button type="submit">Submit</button>
	</form>
)
```

## Creating the api route

Once our component has been created we can then create our API route

Create an API folder in the app folder of your application. Inside that folder
create a contact folder then a route.tsx file.

Now we can start making our POST request

```tsx
export const POST = async (req: Request) => {}
```

We can also do some initial validation to make sure the data passed to us is
what we're looking for

```tsx
const body = await req.json()

const { email, name, subject, message } = body

if (!email || !name || !subject || !message) {
	return new NextResponse('bad request', { status: 400 })
}
```

Now we'll get into the fun stuff. Import nodemailer. Due to typescript typing
errors, you may need to include the // @ts-ignore

```tsx
// @ts-ignore
import nodemailer from 'nodemailer'
```

Now lets create the transporter. Let's start by creating a .env file at the root
of your application. In that folder create two variables EMAIL and EMAIL_PASS.
EMAIL will be your gmail and EMAIL_PASS can be a random string of characters.
Now, back in the API route we can use those variables to create the transporter

```tsx
const transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
	service: 'gmail',
	auth: {
		user: process.env.EMAIL,
		pass: process.env.EMAIL_PASS,
	},
	tls: {
		rejectUnauthorized: false,
	},
})
```

We'll also need to initialize some mail options as well

```tsx
const mailOptions = {
	from: process.env.EMAIL,
	to: process.env.EMAIL,
}
```

Finally, we can send the email with the below code

```tsx
await transporter.sendMail({
	...mailOptions,
	subject,
	text: `Name: ${name} Email: ${email} message: ${message}`,
})

return NextResponse.json(body)
```

And thats all you need to send emails with nodemailer. This was a very simple
example on creating a contact form, but you can try to integrate HTML into your
emails, and add more inputs the user can fill out. You can find more information
