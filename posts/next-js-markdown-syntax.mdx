## Introduction

Welcome to our step-by-step guide on how to set up syntax highlighting for code
elements in NextJS 13 when working with Markdown. In the ever-evolving world of
web development, clear and visually appealing code examples can make a world of
difference. Whether you're creating technical documentation, a blog, or any
content where code snippets play a pivotal role, proper syntax highlighting can
significantly enhance the readability and engagement of your audience.

In this tutorial, we'll take you through the process of integrating syntax
highlighting into your NextJS 13 project, which will not only make your code
snippets more aesthetically pleasing but also improve the overall user
experience. You'll be equipped with the knowledge and tools to showcase your
code effectively, making your technical content more informative and engaging.
Let's get started on the path to creating professional, well-highlighted code
examples for your NextJS 13 and Markdown-based projects.

## Requirements

For this tutorial, I expect you've got MDX setup within your NextJS application.

With our application setup, we need to install the rehype-highlight plugin,
which will add CSS classes to different parts of our code snippets (allowing our
chosen highlight.js style to stylise the different parts of the code). To
install the plugin, run this command:

```tsx
$ npm install rehype-highlight
```

## Setting up rehype-highlight

With the plugin installed, we now need to add it to our MDX provider. To do
this, first import the plugin into your "blog" page and add it to the array of
"rehypePlugins":

```tsx
// app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx
import rehypeHighlight from 'rehype-highlight';

const options = {
    mdxOptions: {
        remarkPlugins: [],
        rehypePlugins: [rehypeHighlight],
    }
```

Now we will need to add these options to the **MDXRemote** component

```tsx
// app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx
<MDXRemote
	source={props.content}
	components={{ Button }}
	options={options}
/>
```

## Styling the Code Elements

Using Highlight.js we can choose a theme we want would like to use.

1. Find the theme you want to use:
   [Highlight.js Demo](https://highlightjs.org/demo)

2. Download the theme from Github:
   [Hightlight.js Download](https://github.com/highlightjs/highlight.js/tree/main/src/styles)
3. Create a styles folder at the root of your application
4. Place the css theme downloaded from Github into the folder

We can now import this style into our blog page so it'll automatically be pulled
in by the browser whenever someone enters a page with code blocks:

```tsx
// app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx
import '@/styles/highlight-js/github-dark.css'
```

## Fixing Styles for TailwindCSS

If you're using TailwindCSS, then there is 1 small fix you can make to the .css
file you download. Find the .hljs tag in the file and update it to include
pre:has(.hljs), too:

```tsx
pre:has(.hljs), .hljs {
    color: #c9d1d9;
    background: #0d1117;
}
```

## Using the Syntax Highlighting

To add syntax highlighting to your MDX pages, you need to add the language to
your code blocks, like this:

````tsx
```ts
````

By adding the "ts" language to our codeblock, the block will now be styled with
syntax highlighting:

```tsx
const hello = 'Hello World'

console.log(hello)
```

## Conclusion

In conclusion, syntax highlighting is a valuable tool that can greatly enhance
the presentation and comprehension of code elements in your Next.js 13 project
when working with Markdown. By following the steps outlined in this tutorial,
you've acquired the skills to make your technical content more engaging and
informative. The visual appeal and clarity of your code snippets will not only
capture your readers' attention but also aid in their understanding of your
content.

As you continue to develop and share your knowledge through documentation,
blogs, or any platform where code is a key component, remember that effective
syntax highlighting can be a game-changer. It's a small but impactful step in
ensuring your audience has a seamless learning experience, and it reflects your
commitment to delivering high-quality content.

We hope this guide has been instrumental in your journey to create polished and
professional code examples. As you apply these techniques to your Next.js 13 and
Markdown projects, you'll contribute to a more visually appealing and
comprehensible web development landscape. Keep coding, keep sharing, and keep
making a positive impact with your technical content.
