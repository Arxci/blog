## Introduction

Welcome to the gateway of enhanced security for your Next.js application! In
this guide, we'll delve into the seamless implementation of NextAuth's
Credentials Provider with Prisma as the adapter to interact with your database
for robust and reliable user authentication. As the online realm becomes
increasingly vulnerable to security breaches, safeguarding user data is
paramount. The Credentials Provider feature offered by NextAuth, combined with
Prisma's database interface, presents an accessible and efficient means to
fortify your application's authentication process. Join us on this journey to
explore the steps, intricacies, and the power of this authentication solution to
elevate your app's security to new heights.

## Requirements

For this tutorial, I expect you've got your prisma client set up and connected
with your database

## Initial Setup

We'll need to install a couple of packages to get started

```tsx
$ npm install next-auth bcrypt zod
```

## Registering A User

Let's start by creating an API route in **/api/register/route.ts**

```tsx
// api/register/route.ts

export const POST = async (req: Request) => {
    try {
	    ...
    } catch (error) {
         ...
    }

}
```

We'll want to ensure the data passed is in the correct format. For that we will
create a zod schema. Create a schemas folder at the root of your application and
in there, create a zod.ts file.

```tsx
// schemas/zod.ts

export const RegisterSchema = z.object({
	email: z
		.string()
		.min(1, { message: 'Please enter at least 1 character.' })
		.email('This is not a valid email.'),
	username: z
		.string()
		.min(1, { message: 'Please enter at least 1 character.' }),
	password: z
		.string()
		.min(5, { message: 'Please enter at least 5 characters.' }),
})
```

We can then use this schema to parse the data passed to the API route

```tsx
// api/register/route.ts

import { RegisterSchema } from '@/schemas/zod'

export const POST = async (req: Request) => {
    try {
        // parse the data sent to the API with the zod schema
        const body: { username: string; password: string; email: string } =
            await req.json()

        try {
            await RegisterSchema.parseAsync(body)
        } catch (err) {
            return new NextResponse('Please verify the information is correct.', {
                status: 400,
            })
        }
        ...
    } catch (error) {
         ...
    }
}
```

After the initial validation is complete we can check whether the email provided
is already in use.

```tsx
// api/register/route.ts

export const POST = async (req: Request) => {
    try {
        ...
        // Check if the email provided is already registered to a user
		const userAlreadyExists = await prismaDB.user.findUnique({
			where: {
				email: body.email,
			},
		})

		if (userAlreadyExists) {
			return new NextResponse('Email already in use.', { status: 409 })
		}
        ...
    } catch (error) {
         ...
    }
}
```

Now, we will need to encrypt the password and create the user.

```tsx
// api/register/route.ts

import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

import bcrypt from 'bcrypt'

export const POST = async (req: Request) => {
    try {
        ...
       	// Encrypt the password
		const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(body.password, 10)

		const user = await prismaDB.user.create({
			data: {
				...body,
				password: hashedPassword,
			},
		})

		return NextResponse.json(user)
    } catch (error) {
        ...
    }
}
```

## The NextAuth API route

To add NextAuthJS to a project we will need to create a catch all api route
called **[...nextauth].ts** in **app/api/auth**. This contains the dynamic route
handler for NextAuthJS which will also contain all of your global NextAuthJS
configurations.

```tsx
// app/api/auth/[...nextauth].ts

import NextAuth from 'next-auth/next'
import { NextAuthOptions } from 'next-auth'

export const authOptions: NextAuthOptions = {}

const handler = NextAuth(authOptions as any)

export { handler as GET, handler as POST }
```

## Setting up the Next Options for our API route.

In order to use the Credentials Provider we need to set up our providers in our
catch all api route.

We'll need to assign a name. The name is a label used when signing in that tells
next which provider we should be using.

The Credentials Provider will also have a credentials variable which we will use
to tell Next Auth what sign in data we are expecting

```tsx
// app/api/auth/[...nextauth].ts

import Credentials Provider from 'next-auth/providers/credentials'

export const authOptions: NextAuthOptions = {
	providers: [
		CredentialsProvider({
			name: 'Credentials',

			credentials: {
				password: { label: 'Password', type: 'password' },
				email: { label: 'Email', type: 'email' },
			},
		}),
	],
}
```

## Authorizing The User

The Credentials Provider will take in an authorize function which we will use to
validate the credentials data passed to Next Auth.

```tsx
// app/api/auth/[...nextauth].ts

async authorize(credentials) {
    ...
},
```

The authorize function is a super useful function that allows us to validate the
data passed and then perform error checks.

We will create a schema that will be used to ensure the data passed from the
front end matches the type requirements we will be enforcing.

```tsx
// schemas/zod.ts

export const SignInSchema = z.object({
	email: z
		.string()
		.min(1, { message: 'Please enter at least 1 character.' })
		.email('This is not a valid email.'),
	password: z
		.string()
		.min(5, { message: 'Please enter at least 5 characters.' }),
})
```

Back in our catch all API route, we can parse the data passed in using the
schema we just created

```tsx
// app/api/auth/[...nextauth].ts

// parse the data sent to the API with the zod schema
try {
	await SignInSchema.parseAsync(credentials)
} catch (err) {
	return { error: 'Please verify the information is correct.' } as any
}
```

Once we'll validated the data meets our expected type requirements we will
verify whether the information passed in matches a user in our database.

```tsx
// app/api/auth/[...nextauth].ts

// Check for an existing user in the DB
const user = await prismaDB.user.findUnique({
	where: {
		email: credentials.email,
	},
})

if (!user) {
	return {
		error: 'Please verify the information and try again.',
	} as any
}
```

If we were able to locate a valid user in our database, we will then check the
password passed in matches the encrypted password for our user.

```tsx
// app/api/auth/[...nextauth].ts

// Decrypt the password and validate
const isMatchingPassword = await bcrypt.compare(
	credentials.password,
	user.password
)

if (!isMatchingPassword) {
	return {
		error: 'Please verify the information and try again.',
	} as any
}
```

After we've successfully validated the user date we just return the user object
that was returned from our database.

```tsx
// app/api/auth/[...nextauth].ts

return user
```

## NextAuth Callbacks

NextAuth.js allows you to hook into various parts of the authentication flow via
built-in callbacks.

We will use the sign in callback to check for errors passed from our authorize
function and return an error.

```tsx
// app/api/auth/[...nextauth].ts

export const authOptions: NextAuthOptions = {
    ...
    callbacks: {
        async signIn({ user }: {user: User }) {
            if (user?.error) {
                throw new Error(user?.error)
            }
            return true
        },
    }
}
```

We can then use this error message to display a message on the front end.

This is really nice and all, but how can we persist a users login information?

NextAuth makes it super simple. By setting the session strategy to **jwt**
NextAuth will be able to persist the users login.

We will also need to set up an environment variable called **NEXTAUTH_SECRET**.
This should be a **secure**, **long**, and **random** string of characters.

```tsx
// app/api/auth/[...nextauth].ts

export const authOptions: NextAuthOptions = {
    ...
    session: {
		strategy: 'jwt',
	},
    secret: process.env.NEXTAUTH_SECRET,
}
```

## Session Provider

NextAuth makes it extremely convenient to access the session data from the front
end. We will need to create a session provider to access the state globally.

```tsx
// providers/session-provider.tsx

'use client'

import { SessionProvider as Provider } from 'next-auth/react'

const SessionProvider = ({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) => {
	return <Provider>{children}</Provider>
}

export default SessionProvider
```

At the root of your application, you'll need to wrap your application in the
SessionProvider.

```tsx
// app/layout.tsx

<SessionProvider>{children}</SessionProvider>
```

## Accessing The Session Object

On the client side you can use the **useSession** hook to fetch the session
data.

```tsx
// app/components/Component.tsx

import { useSession } from 'next-auth/react'

export default function Component() {
	const { data: session, status } = useSession()

	if (status === 'authenticated') {
		return <p>Signed in as {session.user.email}</p>
	}

	return <a href="/api/auth/signin">Sign in</a>
}
```

We can also fetch the session object on the server as such.

```tsx
// app/components/Component.tsx

import { getServerSession } from 'next-auth'
import { authOptions } from '@/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route'

export default function Component() {
	const session = await getServerSession(authOptions)

	if (session) {
		return <p>Signed in as {session.user.email}</p>
	}

	return <a href="/api/auth/signin">Sign in</a>
}
```

By default the session object includes parameters for **name**, **email**, and
**image**. But how can we enhance this to include our user id?

This is also quite simple. For example, to pass a value from the sign-in to the
frontend, client-side, you can use a combination of the **session** and **jwt**
callbacks like so:

```tsx
// app/api/auth/[...nextauth].ts

import { User, Session } from 'next-auth'
import { JWT } from 'next-auth/jwt'
export const authOptions: NextAuthOptions = {
    ...
    async jwt({ token, user }: { token: JWT; user: User }) {
        if (user) {
            return {
                ...token,
                id: user.id,
            }
        }

        return token
    },
    async session({ token, session }: { token: JWT; session: Session }) {
        return {
            ...session,
            user: {
                ...session.user,
                id: token.id,
            },
        }
    },
}
```

In this example here, we are passing an additional field **id** which will then
be exposed to our user on the front end.

## Module Augmentation

For TypeScript users, you may notice a typing error when trying to modify the
session object in this way. In order to fix this, we will need to augment the
existing types.

```tsx
// types/next-auth.d.ts

import NextAuth, { Account, DefaultSession, User } from 'next-auth'
import { JWT } from 'next-auth/jwt'

declare module 'next-auth' {
	interface Session {
		user: {
			id: string
		}
	}
}

declare module 'next-auth/jwt' {
	interface JWT {
		id: string
	}
}
```

We can create a **next-auth.d.ts** file in a **types** folder and modify the
existing types to include an id prop.

## SignIn and SignOut

NextAuth comes with two functions signIn and signOut.

```tsx
import { signIn } from 'next-auth/react'

data = {email: 'johnDoe@gmail.com' password: 'abcd1234'}

signIn('credentials', { ...data})
```

The first argument is the name we assigned to our credentials provider. The next
parameter will be the data passed to NextAuth to authenticate the user. In this
example, the email and password.
